### Description 
A classic game of tic-tac-toe!

Number of players: 2

#### How to Play
Never played tic-tac-toe before? No worries, you'll be a pro in no time! There are two players, in this case ðŸŒ¸ and ðŸŒ¼ , and the objective of the game is to get 3 of your tokens in a row. This can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. At the top of the screen, you'll see a display to show which player's turn it is.
#### How to Win
The current player will choose a square to place their token, then it will be the next player's turn. This continues until a player gets a win (3 in a row, remember?!). If neither player is able to place 3 tokens in a row, the game will then be considered a **draw**. In a draw, neither opponent will win, and the board will reset. If a player does win the game, their win column will start collecting how many games they have won, their win will be displayed at the top of the screen, and the board will reset to begin a new game. 
#### How to Reset 
If you want to start fresh with your win counts back at 0, no worries! Just click the 'Reset Game' button at the bottom of the board and both players' scores will reset back to 0.

### Project Wins 
I felt like I was much more comfortable dealing with local storage on this project than on a previous project. I remember previously making it feel a lot more complicated/scary than it needed to be, and I'm proud of myself for working through it. I also remember feeling very intimidated when we were first introduced to this project, and I'm proud of myself for taking some deep breaths and tackling it. 

### Project Challenges 
Previously I stated that local storage was a win, and it was, but I did get stuck for a moment on displaying the local storage on the DOM on page refresh. I also struggled for a while with checking for win conditions and draw conditions, and my initial function for win conditions was 30 lines long. After some help from my mentor, I was able to take a step back and see a way to refactor. Lastly, I dealt with the constant battle of "What's manipulating the data model, and what's manipulating the DOM". Overall, I learned a lot from this project and that's always my main goal!
