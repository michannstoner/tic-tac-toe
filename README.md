### Description 
A classic game of tic-tac-toe!
Min Players: 2
Max Players: 2

### How to Play
Never played tic-tac-toe before? No worries, you'll be a pro in no time! There are two players, in this case ðŸŒ¸ and ðŸŒ¼ , and the objective of the game is to get 3 of your tokens in a row. This can be vertical, horizontal, or diagonal. At the top of the screen, you'll see a display to show which player's turn it is.
#### How to Win
The current player will choose a square to place their token, then it will be the next player's turn. This continues until a player gets a win (3 in a row, remember?!). If neither player is able to place 3 tokens in a row, the game will then be considered a **draw**. In a draw, neither opponent will win, and the board will reset. If a player does win the game, their win column will start collecting how many games they have won, their win will be displayed at the top of the screen, and the board will reset to begin a new game. 
#### How to Reset 
If you want to start fresh with your win counts back at 0, no worries! Just click the 'Reset Game' button at the bottom of the board and both players' scores will reset back to 0.
